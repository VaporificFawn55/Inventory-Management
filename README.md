# Inventory-Management
C++ Program that requests a file from the user and allows the user to manage it's data through it
This program is a inventory checking software where the user inputs a file to be read in order to print out one of two files. 
The first menu option displays a file that is an overview of all the parts that are available while displaying the different parts available and the total value of all the
parts.
The second menu item is another report that shows the user the items that need to be restocked because the amount of the items is less than the minimum quantity,
the total amount of items needed to be purchased and the total price of restocking the items.
The third menu item allows the user to enter a item name and add it into the inventory_file.dat and add a quantity, if the item does not exist, it gives the user the option
of adding it to the file.
